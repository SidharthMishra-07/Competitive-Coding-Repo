1. What is Template and Why use Templates?

>> The simple idea of template is to pass data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for  different data types.
For eg:

** Without templates **
class Vector{
    int *arr;
    int size;
    Public:
        void store();
        void dsiplay();
}
If I want to use a 'char' array or an array with 'floating values' then I would have to create another class VecChar or VecFloat with char and float datatypes resp , which will be a very tedious work.
Instead with Templates, we just have to write code once and it will work for all data types

**With Templates** (Syntax of Templates)

template <class T>      //(Here T can be int,float,char,etc...)
class Vector{
    T *arr;
    T size;
    Public:
        void store();
        Vector(T *a); //Constructor with an array parameter
}
