Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order. No two mapped values can have same key values.

std:: map <key_type, data_type>

* Declaration:
map<string,int> m ;    //Creates a map 'm' where key_type is of type string and data_type is of type int.

*Insertion
map<string,int> marksMap;       //Creates a map called marksMap and assigns values to keys 'Boy1','Boy2',....
    marksMap["Boy1"]=100;
    marksMap["Boy2"]=60;
    marksMap["Boy3"]=70;
    marksMap["Boy4"]=90;
            OR 
    marksMap.insert({{"Kozume", 169}, {"Kuroo", 187}});        

* Accessing the value stored in the key:
To get the value stored of the key "MAPS" we can do m["MAPS"] or we can get the iterator using the find function and then by itr->second we can access the value.
